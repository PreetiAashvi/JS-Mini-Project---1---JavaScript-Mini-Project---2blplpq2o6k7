# Music Player Master
Online music players have become essential for consuming music on the internet. Music players allow one to enjoy music in any browser and supports a lot of the features of an offline music player. I created a music player with a clean user interface that can be used to play music in the browser. I implemented features like play button that can be used to play audio files, the previous and next track buttons.

# Process
 I started the project by creating the HTML layout first that defines the structure of the player, make it look good by styling using CSS and then write the player logic for all the functions in JavaScript.

## Built with:

1. Semantic HTML5 markup
2. CSS custom properties
3. Java Script
